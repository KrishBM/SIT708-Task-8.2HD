## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Grammar Analysis Engine**
```java
private int analyzeGrammar(String userAnswer) {
    int grammarScore = 85; // Start with good score
    
    // Advanced grammar checking
    if (hasRunOnSentences(userAnswer)) grammarScore -= 10;
    if (hasInconsistentTense(userAnswer)) grammarScore -= 8;
    if (hasCapitalizationIssues(userAnswer)) grammarScore -= 5;
    if (hasPunctuationIssues(userAnswer)) grammarScore -= 7;

    return Math.max(grammarScore, 40);
}
```

### **Content Quality Assessment**
```java
private int analyzeContent(String userAnswer, String jobCategory) {
    int contentScore = 70;
    
    // Keyword relevance scoring
    List<String> relevantKeywords = getJobKeywords(jobCategory);
    long keywordCount = relevantKeywords.stream()
        .mapToLong(keyword -> countOccurrences(userAnswer.toLowerCase(), keyword))
        .sum();
    
    contentScore += Math.min((int)(keywordCount * 5), 25);
    
    // Bonus for examples and metrics
    if (containsSpecificExamples(userAnswer)) contentScore += 15;
    if (containsQuantifiableResults(userAnswer)) contentScore += 10;
    
    return Math.min(contentScore, 100);
}
```
