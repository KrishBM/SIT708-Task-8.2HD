            return "Audio recording error";
        case SpeechRecognizer.ERROR_NETWORK:
            return "Network error";
        case SpeechRecognizer.ERROR_NO_MATCH:
            return "No speech input matched";
        // ... more detailed error cases
    }
}
```

### Visual Feedback System

```java
// Real-time UI updates during recording
private void updateRecordingUI(boolean recording, String status) {
    recordingStatusText.setText(status);
    
    if (recording) {
        startRecordingButton.setText("🎤 Stop Recording");
        startRecordingButton.setBackgroundTintList(
            ContextCompat.getColorStateList(this, R.color.error));
        recordingIndicator.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
        recordingProgress.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
    } else {

        // Reset to normal state
    }
}
```

### Voice Level Visualization

```java
// Real-time voice level feedback
@Override
public void onRmsChanged(float rmsdB) {
    if (recordingProgress != null) {
        int progress = (int) Math.min(100, Math.max(0, (rmsdB + 10) * 5));
        recordingProgress.setProgress(progress);
    }
